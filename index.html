        <h1>CSS display Property</h1>
        <div id="usage">
          <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
          <p>
            The CSS display property is used to specify the display behavior of
            an HTML element. It controls whether an element is rendered as a
            block, inline, inline-block, table, or none. The display property is
            a crucial tool for controlling the layout of web pages and is often
            used in conjunction with other CSS properties such as position,
            float, and flexbox.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="inline">
          <h2>Inline</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: inline </span>" property in CSS specifies that
            an element should be rendered inline, meaning that it should appear
            within the text flow of a document and not create a new line.
            Elements with this property can be nested within other inline
            elements, and multiple inline elements can appear next to each other
            horizontally. Additionally, the width and height properties are
            ignored for inline elements, and margins and padding only affect the
            left and right sides, not the top and bottom.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="block">
          <h2>Block</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: block </span>" property is a CSS style property
            that sets an element to be displayed as a block-level element. This
            means that the element takes up the full width of its parent
            container and creates a line break before and after it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Block-level elements are commonly used for structural elements such
            as headings, paragraphs, and lists. They can also be used to create
            containers for other elements or to visually group content together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, block-level elements have properties such as width,
            height, margin, and padding that can be manipulated to control their
            layout and positioning within their parent container. Overall, the
            "<span> display: block </span>" property is a useful tool for
            creating clear and organized layouts on a webpage.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="contents">
          <h2>Contents</h2>
          <p>
            The CSS property "<span> display: contents </span>" is a new
            experimental feature that is currently not widely supported by most
            web browsers. This property is used to define the layout of content
            within a container element. When applied, it removes the container
            element from the document flow and replaces it with the content it
            contains, essentially hiding the container itself and only showing
            its contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property is particularly useful when you need to create a
            custom layout or design that requires the content to be displayed in
            a specific way. It allows you to manipulate the layout of your
            content without affecting the overall structure of your HTML code.
            However, due to its limited support, it is not recommended to use
            this property in production websites until it becomes more widely
            supported.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="flex">
          <h2>Flex</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: flex </span>" property is a flexible layout
            model that allows elements to be arranged in a row or column, and
            provides a set of powerful alignment and distribution options. When
            applied to a parent container, the child elements become flexible
            boxes that can be resized and repositioned based on their content or
            available space. This property enables responsive design and makes
            it easy to create complex layouts with a minimum of code.
            Additionally, it offers a range of features such as flexible sizing,
            order control, alignment and justification options, and even
            supports wrapping of flex items when the container overflows.
            Overall, the "<span> display: flex </span>" property is a powerful
            tool for creating modern, dynamic layouts that adapt to different
            screen sizes and devices.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="grid">
          <h2>Grid</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display grid </span>" property in CSS allows you to
            create complex layouts by dividing a web page into rows and columns.
            This property provides a two-dimensional grid system that enables
            you to position and align elements precisely. With grid, you can
            control the size of each grid item, the gaps between them, and their
            placement within the grid. This property is highly flexible and
            allows you to create responsive layouts that adjust to different
            screen sizes and devices. Overall, display grid is a powerful tool
            for creating dynamic and visually appealing web layouts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="inline-block">
          <h2>Inline-block</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: inline-block </span>" property in CSS combines
            the properties of both "<span> display: inline </span>" and "<span>
              display: block </span
            >". It allows an element to be displayed as an inline-level block
            container, which means it can be placed inline with other elements
            but also has a width and height that can be specified.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property is particularly useful when you want to create
            elements that behave like inline elements, but also have a
            block-level layout. It also allows you to add padding and margins to
            the element, which is not possible with the "<span>
              display: inline </span
            >" property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inline-block elements can also be used to create multi-column
            layouts, and they work well for aligning items horizontally or
            vertically within a container. However, it's important to note that
            inline-block elements can sometimes create unexpected spacing and
            alignment issues, so it's important to use them carefully and test
            their behavior across different browsers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="inline-flex">
          <h2>Inline-flex</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: inline-flex </span>" property in CSS combines
            the characteristics of both the "inline" and "flex" display types.
          </p>
          <p>
            When applied to an element, it allows the element to be treated as
            an inline-level element, meaning it will sit within the normal text
            flow of the document, while also allowing it to use the flexbox
            layout properties, such as "flex-direction" and "justify-content".
          </p>
          <p>
            This is particularly useful for creating responsive layouts where
            elements need to be flexible and adjust to different screen sizes,
            while still maintaining their position within the text flow of the
            document. Additionally, "<span> display: inline-flex </span>" allows
            for easy centering of elements both vertically and horizontally, as
            well as providing the ability to space elements evenly along a
            horizontal or vertical axis.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="inline-grid">
          <h2>inline-grid</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: inline-grid </span>" property in CSS allows you
            to create an inline-level grid container, meaning that the container
            will behave like an inline-level element such as a span or an anchor
            tag. This property is useful when you want to create a grid layout
            that flows with the text content on the page, rather than disrupting
            the natural flow of the content. An inline-level grid container will
            only take up as much space as necessary to display its contents, and
            its grid items will be arranged in a grid pattern within the
            container.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="inline-table">
          <h2>Inline-table</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: inline-table </span>" property in CSS allows an
            element to be displayed as a table, but within the flow of text as
            if it were an inline-level element. This means that other elements
            can sit next to it on the same line, just as if it were an
            inline-level element like text or an image. However, the contents of
            the inline-table will still be laid out like a table, with rows and
            columns, and it can have its own padding, borders, and background
            color. This property is useful when you want to display tabular
            data, but you don't want to take up a full line or break the flow of
            text.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="list-item">
          <h2>List-item</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: list-item </span>" property is used to create a
            list item element, which is typically used in an ordered or
            unordered list. When applied to an element, it changes its display
            behavior to that of a list item, which includes rendering a bullet
            or numbering for each item by default.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the visual styling, list items also have certain
            properties that affect their behavior, such as the ability to be
            nested within other list items, and the ability to be styled
            differently depending on their position within the list. Overall,
            "<span> display: list-item </span>" is a useful property for
            creating well-structured, semantic lists in HTML and CSS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="run-in">
          <h2>Run-in</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: run-in </span>" property is a CSS feature that
            allows the first line of a block element to be displayed inline with
            the text that follows it. This means that the first line will not
            create a new line or break the flow of text. Instead, it will appear
            as if it is a part of the text that immediately follows it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property is useful in situations where you want to emphasize or
            highlight a particular phrase or sentence within a paragraph,
            without creating a visual break between the highlighted text and the
            rest of the paragraph. By using the "<span> display: run-in </span>"
            property, you can create a seamless transition between the
            highlighted text and the surrounding content, resulting in a more
            visually appealing and cohesive design.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's worth noting that not all browsers support the "<span>
              display: run-in </span
            >" property, so it's important to check browser compatibility before
            using this feature.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table">
          <h2>Table</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table </span>" property in CSS is used to
            define an element as a table-like structure, allowing it to behave
            like a table in terms of layout and formatting. When an element is
            set to "<span> display: table </span>", it creates a block-level
            container that can contain other elements, which can be styled as
            table rows and cells using the "<span> display: table-row </span>"
            and "<span> display: table-cell </span>" properties. This allows for
            more flexibility in layout design, as the content can be organized
            into a structured grid without the need for actual HTML table
            markup.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-caption">
          <h2>Table-caption</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-caption </span>" property is used in CSS
            to specify the display behavior of an element that is used as a
            caption for a table. When applied to an element, it causes the
            element to be displayed as a caption for the table, appearing above
            or below the table depending on the "caption-side" property
          </p>
          <p>
            The "table-caption" element inherits some of the properties of its
            parent table, such as "width" and "border-collapse". It can also
            have its own properties such as "background-color" and "font-size".
            This property is typically used in conjunction with the "table"
            display property to create a complete table structure.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-column-group">
          <h2>Table-column-group</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-column-group </span>" property is used to
            group columns in a table and apply styles to them. It specifies that
            the element should be displayed as a column group in a table.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property is often used in conjunction with other table-related
            properties such as "table-layout" and "border-collapse" to control
            the layout and appearance of the table. When applied to an element,
            it causes the element to behave like a column group, allowing other
            table-related properties to affect it accordingly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-header-group">
          <h2>Table-header-group</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-header-group </span>" CSS property is
            used to specify that an HTML element should be rendered as a group
            header within a table. When this property is applied to an element,
            it causes the element to be displayed as a row that acts as a header
            for a group of rows within the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property is typically used in conjunction with the "<span>
              display: table-row-group </span
            >" property to group together a set of rows within a table and
            provide them with a header. The "table-header-group" element is
            positioned before the "table-row-group" element in the table
            structure, and any styles applied to it will affect the entire group
            of rows that follow it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the "<span> display: table-header-group </span>" property
            is a useful tool for structuring tables and creating a clear visual
            hierarchy within tabular data.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-footer-group">
          <h2>Table-footer-group</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-footer-group </span>" property is a CSS
            display property value that is used to control the rendering of
            table elements in HTML. When applied to a table-footer-group
            element, it causes the element to behave as a table footer group,
            which is used to group and display the footer rows of a table.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property is typically used in conjunction with other
            table-related properties to control the layout and appearance of
            table elements on a webpage. By using the "<span>
              display: table-footer-group </span
            >" property, designers can control the size, positioning, and other
            visual properties of the footer group to achieve the desired effect.
            Overall, this property provides a powerful tool for controlling the
            presentation of table elements on a webpage.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-row-group">
          <h2>Table-row-group</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-row-group </span>" property is used in
            CSS to define a group of rows within a table. When this property is
            applied to an HTML element, it causes the element to behave like a
            "tbody" tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elements with "<span> display: table-row-group </span>" are used to
            group a set of table rows that belong together, such as a table
            header, a table body, or a table footer. This property allows for
            greater control over the layout and presentation of a table,
            allowing developers to create more complex and dynamic tables with
            ease.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-cell">
          <h2>Table-cell</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-cell </span>" property is used to specify
            that an HTML element should behave like a table cell. This means
            that the element will be displayed as an inline-level block
            container that can be aligned vertically and horizontally within a
            table row.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an element is displayed as a table cell, it can also inherit
            certain properties of a table cell, such as the ability to have
            padding and borders, and the ability to stretch or shrink to fit the
            size of its contents or its parent container. This property is
            commonly used in conjunction with the "<span> display: table </span
            >" property to create table-like layouts using CSS instead of
            traditional HTML table tags.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-column">
          <h2>Table-column</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-column </span>" property is used to
            define a table column within a table layout. When this property is
            applied to an HTML element, it makes it behave like a table column,
            allowing other table cells to align with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property can be useful when creating complex table layouts, as
            it provides more control over how columns are arranged and aligned.
            Additionally, it can be used to specify various styling options for
            the column, such as setting the width, height, or background color.
            Overall, the "<span> display: table-column </span>" property is an
            important tool for web developers who want to create dynamic and
            responsive tables on their websites.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="table-row">
          <h2>Table-row</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: table-row </span>" property is used to specify
            that an element should be displayed as a row within a table. This
            property is typically used in conjunction with the "<span>
              display: table </span
            >" and "<span> display: table-cell </span>" properties to create
            table layouts in HTML and CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an element is set to "<span> display: table-row </span>", it
            will behave like a table row in terms of layout and positioning.
            This means that it will stretch to fill the width of its container
            and its height will be determined by the content of its table cells.
            Additionally, table rows will typically be separated from one
            another by a horizontal line, which can be styled using the "border"
            property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, "<span> display: table-row </span>" is a useful property
            for creating table layouts in CSS, allowing for a flexible and
            responsive design that can adapt to different screen sizes and
            device types.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="none">
          <h2>None</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: none</span> " property is a CSS property that
            can be used to hide an element on a web page. When this property is
            applied to an element, it removes it from the flow of the document
            and the space it occupied is no longer taken into account in the
            layout. This means that the element will not be visible to the user,
            and will not affect the positioning of other elements on the page.
            Additionally, any child elements of the hidden element will also be
            hidden. This property can be useful for creating dynamic effects or
            for hiding elements that should only be displayed under certain
            conditions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="initial">
          <h2>Initial</h2>
          <p>
            The CSS property "<span> display: initial </span>" sets an element
            to its default initial value for the "display" property, which
            varies depending on the element type. For example, the default
            display value for most elements is "inline", while the default for a
            "div" element is "block".
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting an element's "display" property to "initial" essentially
            resets it to its default value, undoing any previous "display"
            property modifications that may have been made. This can be useful
            when you want to quickly reset an element's display behavior without
            needing to know or specify its default value explicitly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="inherit">
          <h2>Inherit</h2>
          <p>
            The "<span> display: inherit </span>" property in CSS specifies that
            an element should inherit the display value of its parent element.
            This means that if the parent element has a display value of
            "block," for example, then the child element will also be displayed
            as a block-level element. Conversely, if the parent element has a
            display value of "inline," then the child element will be displayed
            inline. This property is useful for maintaining consistency in the
            layout and styling of nested elements.
